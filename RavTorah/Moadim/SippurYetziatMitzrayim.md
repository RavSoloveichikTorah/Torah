Sippur, as in Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim, comes from the word Saper, the
same root that includes Sofer, which is Hebrew for scribe. A scribe is not
the same as a simple writer. Throughout Tanach the word Sofer 
indicates that the position of scribe was one of importance, for example
Sofrei Hamelech in Megilas Esther. In Talmudic parlance, Sofer means a
Talmid Chacham, a scholar. In contrast to Divray Torah we have the term
Divrei Sofrim, which are the teachings of the scholars. There are many
examples in the Talmud where the word Sofer refers to the scholar.
Apparently the Hebrew language scribe or scholar is distinguished by his
ability to write. A Talmid Chacham must be capable of writing.
Historically, when a Jew showed the ability to write, he was accepted as a
scholar. The statements of the transmitters of learning, the Maatikay
Hashemuah, are referred to as Divray Sofrim.

The definition of Sippur goes beyond simple oral story telling, but it
includes the ability to tell a story through writing it down. The word
Sefer, book, derives from the same root, L'Saper, to tell a story. In
Hebrew, writing and oral communication are both included in the
framework of the root word Saper. The Gemara says that Megilas Esther
refers to itself first as an Igeres, letter, and later as a Sefer, a book. There
are significant differences between these 2 forms of writing. A letter is
written for a short term purpose. It does not need to be written on
parchment; it can be missing letters and may not be complete yet it still
conveys the gist of the story. In contrast, a Sefer is intended to transmit
the story to future generations. It requires parchment and if even one 
letter is missing it is halachically voided. For example, the prophet
commanded the people to write contracts on their land in a Sefer and
place them in earthen vessels so that they may last a long time. Sefer
documents an event for present and future generations. Another example:
Hashem commanded Moshe to document the eternal conflict between
God and Amalek in the Sefer and transmit it to Joshua. This message
could only be transmitted through a Sefer.

Chazal note that a major Kabbalah principle is that Hashem created the
world through acts of Kesiva, writing. For example, the notion of writing
is found by the 10 commandments that were written Betzba Elokim,
K'vayachol, by the finger of God. The Sefer Hayetzira maintains that the
world was created through 3 Seforim (forms of the word Saper): B'sfor,
B'sippur U'Bsefer, through counting, relating a story and through the
book. We know from the Torah that Hashem wrote the Luchos, but how
does the Sefer Yetzira know that the world was created through these 3
forms of the word Saper? According to the Kuzari, when the Torah
repeatedly mentions Vayomer Elokim, it is referring to the act of Sippur
by Hashem. The result of this Sippur was the Sefer, all of creation. It was
the word of God that created the world and is embedded in nature and
continues to drive it. At the same time, nature must obey the will of
Hashem. If  the flowers bloom, the birds fly, man walks and the heavenly
bodies remain in motion it is because this is the Ratzon Hashem, the will
of God. The manifestation of the will of God was inscribed into every
function of nature. According to the Baal Shem Tov, the word of God,
the Vayomer Elokim, that created everything is as real and ongoing today
as it was at the time of creation, Udvarcha Emes Vkayam Load, and Your
words are true and everlasting.

Chazal valued very highly of the ability to write. Chazal say that Ksav
Vmichtav were among the miraculous things that were created at twilight
of the sixth day prior to the onset of the Shabbos. Chazal recognized the
amazing gift in the ability of man to  to record events that happened
thousands of years ago in such a way as to allow subsequent generations
to identify with, understand and appreciate the thoughts and feelings that
moved the author so many years before. The events of past generations
are alive for us today. For example, when we read in the Torah the stories
of the patriarchs and the 12 tribes, we feel as if we are part of the actual
events that are unfolding before us. We cry with Joseph when he is sold
into slavery by the brothers and we rejoice with him when he is elevated
to the position of Viceroy of Egypt. We travel with Abraham as he leaves
Charan for the unknown land of Canaan and our hearts skip a beat as
Yaakov narrowly departs with the blessings before Esau enters his
father's room. Reading the written word allows us to span generations in
an instant and to identify with our ancestors. Educators today must make
the stories of the Torah come alive for their students and make them feel
as if they are part of the story and not some impartial bystander.

In contrast, the Rav noted that today, unfortunately, parents and children
can't communicate across a gap of a single generation. Children of today
can't understand or relate to the experiences of their parents. To many
Jews today, the Lech Lecha of their parents, their life experiences and
their Judaism, means nothing to them. In order for us to inject meaning
into the stories that we write during our lives, we must do more than
simply put words on paper. We have to create a climate through which
we appreciate all the events that shaped Jewish history, for example to
feel the pain of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash or to understand
other events in Jewish history. Today we have many aids to study,
unprecedented numbers of  translations of the various texts are readily
available to the masses to assist them in study. However in too many
cases, we have words written on paper, but we lack the atmosphere of
involvement and participation in the events we study. The greatest Sofer,
scribe, is not one who can write on parchment or paper, but rather the one
who can write on the hearts of living beings and influence their lives. The
great scribe is the one that can transmit a living Torah that passes on the
Torah world of Rabbi Akiva, the Rambam and the Vilna Gaon to the next
generation. This is Torah Shbeal Peh, which is dependant on the ability of
each generation to make these experiences come alive for the subsequent
generation to ensure that the flame of Torah burns for eternity. The
scholars were called Sofrim because they were the transmitters of the
tradition between generations. Their greatest accomplishment was not the
writing of Torah on paper, but rather etching Torah into the hearts and
souls of their students to keep it alive for subsequent generations, creating
living Seforim.

One need not write tomes during his life to earn the title of Sofer. For
example, we have no recorded writings from the Baal Shem Tov. Yet his
vast Torah was spread throughout the world by his living Seforim, the
many students that he taught during his life. Moshe Rabbeinu was called
Safra Rabba D'Yisrael, the great scribe of Israel. Did Moshe spend his
time as a scribe of Sifrei Torah, Tefilin and Mezuzos (STAM)? We find
that Moshe wrote a Sefer Torah towards the end of his life. Yet he earned
the title as the great scribe in Israel because of the Torah he taught all
Bnay Yisrael and how he inscribed it into the parchment of their hearts
and souls so that they might act as the scribes that would teach the next
generation. Just as the original word of God continues to drive nature, so
to the Torah that Moshe gave Bnay Yisrael in the desert is as alive for us
today as it was thousands of years ago. It is the ability to transmit from
generation to generation, despite great difficulties, without diluting the
message that makes Bnay Yisrael unique.

Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim is more than telling a story. Vhigadta L'Bincha
means that the father must write the book that will become his son. It is
the obligation of the father to view his son as a Sefer to be carefully
written and not as an Igeres. The obligation to be the scribe of this book
extends well beyond the Seder night to encompass all of life. Bchal Dor
V'dor Chayav Adam Liros Es Atzmo K'ilu Hu Yataza M'Mitzrayim, in
every generation the Jew must view himself as if he has just left Egypt.
Man must feel that he has participated in the entire, collective Jewish
experience and he must inscribe this knowledge into the book that is his
child. Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim is the book of Jewish existence. The
greatest accomplishment is when a father carefully transmits his
experiences so that he may pass it on intact to his child before he passes
on.

There were many great scholars who were not able to permanently
inscribe themselves into the Sefer that was their children. They were only
able to write an Igeres, a short term note, that their  children quickly
erased when they left home. Yet there are simple parents who succeeded
in making a permanent inscription into their children's personality. They
were able to write on the hearts of their children their Seder, their feelings
on Tisha Bav, the beauty of their Shabbos, the solemnity of their Yom
Kippur and their blessing of their children before Kol Nidrei in a way that
made a lasting impression on the child, an impression that stayed with
him throughout many years of separation and struggle. The Rav asked
why should the scholar fail where the simple person succeeds?

Chazal say that there  are 10 synonyms for prophecy, one of which is the
word Masa. There are 2 explanations why Masa refers to prophecy. The
first is that the prophet would raise his voice when presenting the
message of God to the people. The second is the Rambam in the Guide
(Moreh Nvuchim) who explains that Masa is used to indicate that
prophecy was a heavy load for the prophet to bear. The essence of
prophecy is that it is a truth entrusted only to the specific prophet. He is
the only one privileged to know this truth communicated to him by
Hashem. The vision is a burden that does not let him rest. He has a need
to spurt forth spontaneously and a desire to share it with others. For
example, when someone is entrusted with a secret they have a difficult
time maintaining the confidence. They find themself constantly struggling
to refrain from blurting it out. The prophet seeks to unburden himself by
telling the message of God to others.

When it comes to a prophecy or to Torah that a Jew knows, the only
relief from his load comes through sharing it with others. The Rambam
says that the prophet is required to tell his prophecy to others even when
he knows that his intended audience is not interested in the message and
may seek to harm him as a result of it, even if it costs him his life.
Jeremiah was an example of a prophet who wanted to hold back his
prophecy when the scoffers opposed him but he could not hold it back.
When the Jew has a prophecy or Torah to transmit, he must view it as a
Masa, a heavy burden, that in order to endure must be transmitted with
great care and exactness as a Sefer to the next generation and not as an
Igeres.

The ability of the Jewish parent to sacrifice themself for their child is so
great that it approaches the point of self negation. How can such a person
refrain from transmitting to his child the beauty of Shabbos, Yom Tov,
Tanach or Torah Shebal Peh and the great Jewish personalities? Like the
prophet of old, he can't control himself, he must blurt out the message. If
he does not transmit it to his child, the reason must be because he himself
is lacking the feeling for these things. In order to be a successful scribe,
you yourself must feel the burden of prophecy, the Masa Dvar Hashem.

In essence, this is the Mitzvah of Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim, V'Higadta
L'Bincha, and you shall instruct your children. A Jew must present his
child with a Sefer and not an Igeres. Inscribing such a Sefer for the next
generation is the way for every Jew to attain the level of prophecy in his
lifetime. If you would ask what is the greatest characteristic of Knesses
Yisrael, it is the  great wonder of Jewish History, the ability to engage in
Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim not just on Pesach night. It is the ability for one
generation to turn the subsequent generation into its carefully written
Sefer.

The Rav noted that the night of Pesach is a symbol for this inter-generational transmission process. 
We are all familiar with the story of
the great rabbis that were assembled in Bnay Brak and were involved in
Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim all that night till dawn. The Rav asked which
night was it? The Rav interpreted the night as extending beyond that
immediate night of Pesach. The "Night" refers to the long and dark exile
period that we have endured for 2 thousand years. It is the long night of
pogroms and blood libels and crusades and inquisitions and holocaust
that we have endured. Not only were Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi
Tarfon and Rabbi Yehoshua at that table, but Gedolei Rishonim and
Achronim who lived through the rain of Jewish blood and misery
throughout the ages were there as well. Yet despite all these difficulties,
Gedolei Yisrael recognized that they had a mission to be the scribes of
the their generation, not in terms of writing books but as scribes that
engrave a love of Torah in the heart of each Jew. Gedolei Yisrael carried
the burden, the Masa Hashem, and transmitted their Torah as an inter-generational Sefer and not as a fleeting Igeres. They seized on the method
Hashem uses, the Sippur Bsefer, writing on the book of creation, to
ensure the continuity of faith in Hashem and the eternity of the Jewish
people. The Torah remains alive to us today because of them. If not for
their efforts, we would not be able to sit at our Seder table and discuss the
exodus on the night of Pesach.  Jews are called the Am Hasefer, the
people of the book, not because they are avid readers, but because each
and every Jew is a living book that has been authored by the previous
generations.

How long must we function as Sofrim, as scribes? When does the Jew complete his assignment of studying Torah? How long must we emulate
the ways that Hashem created the world, through Sfor, Sippur and Sefer? Until we see that the next generation is ready to shoulder the load and
assume its role in this never ending chain. Until the students knock on their teachers' door and say "Our Teachers, the time to recite the morning
Shema has arrived", that they are now ready to assume the leadership role. The essence of Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim is to create the living books, the Seforim, that will ensure the continuity of Torah and Judaism, is not limited to the night of Pesach. It is an eternal mission.
