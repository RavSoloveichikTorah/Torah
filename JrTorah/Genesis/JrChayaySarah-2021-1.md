When it comes to setting expectations and following through on them, on is advised to under promise and over deliver. Talk is cheap. The proof is in the pudding. No where is this idea more visible than in פרשת חיי שרה. The Gemara tells us (בבא מציעא פז:א):

כתיב (בראשית יח, ה) ואקחה פת לחם וכתיב (בראשית יח, ז) ואל הבקר רץ אברהם אמר רבי אלעזר מכאן שצדיקים אומרים מעט ועושים הרבה רשעים אומרים הרבה ואפילו מעט אינם עושים מנלן מעפרון מעיקרא כתיב (בראשית כג, טו) ארץ ארבע מאות שקל כסף ולבסוף כתיב (בראשית כג, טז) וישמע אברהם אל עפרון וישקל אברהם לעפרון את הכסף אשר דבר באזני בני חת ארבע מאות שקל כסף עובר לסוחר דלא שקל מיניה אלא קנטרי דאיכא דוכתא דקרי ליה לתיקלא קנטירא 

Abraham under promised when he told his guests that he would bring them bread to satiate themselves. He over delivered by bringing them a major meal with all the trimmings. On the other hand, Ephron over promised when he told Abraham that he would give him the מערת המכפלה for a burial plot for Sarah free of charge. He under performed by demanding 400 perfect silver coins before he would allow Abraham to bury Sarah. Indeed the entire local population appeared to be in on the deal and exhibited the same behavior of delivering less than their original commitment. They initially told Abraham to use any burial plot he desired to bury Sarah and ended up observing Ephron's duplicity without comment or protest on behalf of Abraham.

Looking carefully at the dialogue between Abraham and the local Hittite population as well as the conversation with Ephron, one can see how the Torah emphasized the contrast between Ephron and Abraham mentioned by the Gemara. The people initially offer their own burial plots to Abraham. (בראשית כג:ו)
 
 שְׁמָעֵ֣נוּ ׀ אֲדֹנִ֗י נְשִׂ֨יא אֱלֹהִ֤ים אַתָּה֙ בְּתוֹכֵ֔נוּ בְּמִבְחַ֣ר קְבָרֵ֔ינוּ קְבֹ֖ר אֶת־מֵתֶ֑ךָ אִ֣ישׁ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ אֶת־קִבְר֛וֹ לֹֽא־יִכְלֶ֥ה מִמְּךָ֖ מִקְּבֹ֥ר מֵתֶֽךָ׃ 

No price is mentioned and it is not clear if they would have requested payment for the plots. While no one would prevent Abraham from taking their personal burial plots, would they have requested compensation for it? Abraham thanks them for their offer but requests they intercede with Ephron on his behalf so he can purchase, for full value, the specific field and cave he was interested in. The people accompany Abraham when he meets with Ephron. Ephron speaks first and makes a grand offer for all the people to hear: (בראשית כג:יא):
לֹֽא־אֲדֹנִ֣י שְׁמָעֵ֔נִי הַשָּׂדֶה֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לָ֔ךְ וְהַמְּעָרָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֖וֹ לְךָ֣ נְתַתִּ֑יהָ לְעֵינֵ֧י בְנֵי־עַמִּ֛י נְתַתִּ֥יהָ לָּ֖ךְ קְבֹ֥ר מֵתֶֽךָ׃ 

Ephron offers the field as a gift knowing full well that Abraham has already offered to pay full price for it. When Abraham reiterates his offer to pay for the burial plot, Ephron responds:
אֲדֹנִ֣י שְׁמָעֵ֔נִי אֶרֶץ֩ אַרְבַּ֨ע מֵאֹ֧ת שֶֽׁקֶל־כֶּ֛סֶף בֵּינִ֥י וּבֵֽינְךָ֖ מַה־הִ֑וא וְאֶת־מֵתְךָ֖ קְבֹֽר׃ 

Suddenly, Ephron changes his tone and demands an exorbitant sum for the field. Abraham complies:
וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע אַבְרָהָם֮ אֶל־עֶפְרוֹן֒ וַיִּשְׁקֹ֤ל אַבְרָהָם֙ לְעֶפְרֹ֔ן אֶת־הַכֶּ֕סֶף אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֖ר בְּאָזְנֵ֣י בְנֵי־חֵ֑ת אַרְבַּ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שֶׁ֣קֶל כֶּ֔סֶף עֹבֵ֖ר לַסֹּחֵֽר׃ 

Perhaps the key to understanding this story and the behavior of the protagonists is by understanding the use of the word שמע, listen. שמיעה does not mean to simply hear, it means to listen and understand. We refer to Gd as שומע תפלה. Regardless of the response we receive to our supplications, we are confident that Gd listens to them and fully understands them. The word שמע is used by Abraham, Ephron and the Hittite population. The Hittites originally informed Abraham that they are willing to allow Abraham bury Sarah among their own dead. They understood Abraham's desperation to bury Sarah and though offering to assist, they did not preclude charging him for their plots. They use the word שמענו to inform Abraham that their services will not be free. Abraham understands this and informs them he is ready to pay but he has a specific area in mind.

Ephron initially repeats the same offer the local population made to Abraham, to take his plot and bury Sarah. It is interesting that he prefaces his remarks by saying לא אדוני שמעני. Ephron knew full well that his initial offer was a sham and he had no intention of gifting the field to Abraham. However he wanted to sound magnanimous in front of the local Hittite population. So he tells Abraham, do not listen to what I am about to announce, that I am willing to gift you the field,  לא אדוני שמעני, as this statement is not for you but rather it is meant for the local population. I have no intention to follow through on the offer of gifting you the land I am about to make. Abraham hears and understands Ephron's intention and responds publicly that he is prepared to pay for the land:
וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר אֶל־עֶפְר֜וֹן בְּאָזְנֵ֤י עַם־הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַ֛ךְ אִם־אַתָּ֥ה ל֖וּ שְׁמָעֵ֑נִי נָתַ֜תִּי כֶּ֤סֶף הַשָּׂדֶה֙ קַ֣ח מִמֶּ֔נִּי וְאֶקְבְּרָ֥ה אֶת־מֵתִ֖י שָֽׁמָּה׃ 

Ephron now responds directly to Abraham, with no public announcement, אֲדֹנִ֣י שְׁמָעֵ֔נִי, now listen to me my master: the price is 400 universally accepted silver coins. Abraham understands Ephron's intention and complies:
וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע אַבְרָהָם֮ אֶל־עֶפְרוֹן֒ וַיִּשְׁקֹ֤ל אַבְרָהָם֙ לְעֶפְרֹ֔ן אֶת־הַכֶּ֕סֶף אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֖ר בְּאָזְנֵ֣י בְנֵי־חֵ֑ת אַרְבַּ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שֶׁ֣קֶל כֶּ֔סֶף עֹבֵ֖ר לַסֹּחֵֽר׃ 
 
Abraham fulfills the promise he initially made to the local Hittite population, as well as the second commitment he made to Ephron in front of them, to pay full price for Ephron's field. Ephron who initially over promised to give Abraham the field for nothing under delivered by demanding full payment of an exorbitant amount prior to allowing Abraham to bury Sarah.
