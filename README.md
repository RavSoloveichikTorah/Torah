# Torah Shiurim From The Rav, Rav Yosef Dov Halevi Soloveichik T"L

## Purpose of this Repository
This repo contains the summaries i wrote of various shiurim/lectires delivered by the Rav ZT"L over the course of approximately 3o years. Some of the Shiurim were delivered as part of the Rav's well attended yahrtzeit Shiurim as well as his weekly **Blatt Shiur** deliverd at Moriah, on the upper West Side of Manhattan. Also included are transcripts of Shiurim delivered at Mainmonides and at Yeshiva University. The summaries represent my interest in the Rav's unique approach to interpreting Chumash. While many have focused on the Rav's erudition in Talmud specific subjects, I was intrigued in the HAshkafa and messages the Rav conveyed in his various shiurim and lectures that spoke to the Jewish community regardless of label and group afiliation. many of the summaries derive from summaries I posted to mj-ravtorah in the 1990's and subsequently published some of them in a weekly column in the Jewish Press that ran for approximately 2 years. As many of those lectures were edited without my verification or approval, I include them here as well.

While I was fortunate to personally attend some of the lectures, the vast majority were recorded and provided to me by, among others, my father in law, Rabbi Chaim Zev Bomzer ZT"L, a decades long Talmid of the Rav from the early 1950s, as well as taped lectures produced and made avalable for sale by Mr. Milton Nordlicht.
